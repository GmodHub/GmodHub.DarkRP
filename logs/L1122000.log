[ERROR] gamemodes/darkrp/gamemode/libraries/simplerr.lua:530: [ERROR] A runtime error has occurred in "lua/darkrp_customthings/jobs.lua" on line -1.
The best help I can give you is this:

GAMEMODE.DefaultTeam is not set to an existing job.

Hints:
	- This may happen when you disable the default citizen job. Make sure you update GAMEMODE.DefaultTeam to the new default team.
	- GAMEMODE.DefaultTeam may be set to a job that does not exist anymore. Did you remove the job you had set to default?
	- The error being in jobs.lua is a guess. This is usually right, but the problem might lie somewhere else.

The responsibility for the error above lies with (the authors of) one (or more) of these files:
	jobs.lua, settings.lua, disabled_defaults.lua or any of your other custom files.

The best help I can give you is this:

There is a player with an invalid team!

The player's name is COMPLΞX, their team number is "1", which has the name "Citizen"

Hints:
	- It is the server owner's responsibility to figure out why that player has no valid team.
	- This error is very likely to be caused by an earlier error. If you don't see any errors in your own console, look at the server console.
